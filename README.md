# React Native Fintech Home Task — Mini Banking Dashboard


## Repository structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **[backend](./backend)** | Mock API server (Node.js). Run this first so the app has data. |
| **[client](./client)** | Your task: implement the React Native app according to the requirements. |

## Quick start (for reviewers)

1. **Backend** — See [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md) for install and run. Start the server before the app.
2. **Client** — See [client/README.md](./client/README.md) for the full task, screens, and goals. The candidate implements the app in the `client` folder.

## For You

- Read the root README (this file), then open **[client/README.md](./client/README.md)** for the exact task.
- Use the **[backend/README.md](./backend/README.md)** for API base URL, endpoints, and request/response formats.
